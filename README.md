# Number Guesser | JavaScript Syntax, Part I | Codecademy

This repository is a simple number guesser game with the application of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All the source code was given by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).

This repository created to complete the task of the chapter codecademy. My contribution just on JavaScript code with the name [script.js](./script.js).

Feel free to clone and code it by your self to learn more about JavaScript.
